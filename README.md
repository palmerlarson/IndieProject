# Wealth & Debt Evaluator (WDev)

This web application will allow the user to track and map their personal finances. It provides the user with a simplistic view and future tracking for users looking to log and calculate finances. This application is to provide the user with a personalized and simplified view of their financial situation. The difference between this application and current ones on the market is that it is meant to be simplified, personalized, and a one stop shop for personal finance mapping.

## Problem Statement
I have always wanted to use a well built tool to track and map my finances. I wanted to know with simple user inputs what my future finance calculations would be like. This program will do just that, it'll map future debt/wealth/investments. Unlike other "budgeting tools" this platform is meant to be simple to use, and free of charge. This program is meant to help all individuals from people with little wealth/debt to people with a lot. With the user login system, this tracking/mapping program will be able to save your settings so you can update them later.
